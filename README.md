The inquirer package will need to be installed before use of the code. "npm i inquirer" can be used in the command line in order to download the package

## Usage
Within the command line, the user must input "node index.js" in order to initiate the README generator, after which the user will be given each subheading of their new read me file where they can input the relevant information for their new repository. 
After this is done a new file will be created within the folder with the new readme including all information input.
